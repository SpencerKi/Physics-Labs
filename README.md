# Undergraduate Physics Experiments
Scripts, documentation, and reports from the University of Toronto's undergraduate physics labs (PHY*24 series). Every submodule is a separate experiment and includes a PDF report detailing the procedure and use of computational methods.

Electron Charge-to-Mass Ratio, Radioactivity in the Air, Thermal Motion, and Earth Radius scripts were co-authored by Victor Chu.
